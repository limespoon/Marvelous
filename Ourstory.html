        I started watching Marvel as a kid when the X-MEN cartoon came out. In it, the X-men are ostracized by others for simply
        being who they are.. What was cool was that what made them different was what made them powerful.
        Since then, I've loved all the other Marvel stories, especially since so many are based in New York City.
        No matter which you watch, it shows that people at the end of the day, have flaws,but they do their best to be good
        and that's all you can ask for.
        Besides, the movies have some of the most fun soundtracks.

        My very first Marvel movie waas "X-Men First Class". There was something
        that sparked me to indulged me to watch more, 
        I was fascinated. I took it upon my self to learn more about the
        entirety of the "Marvel Universe".
        I love everything about Marvel, from the characters to the movie productions.
        My spirit gets so excited for a new movie or TV show that's in development.
        I get excited because I know what ever it is, it's always going to "LIT".
        I'm a freak for Marvel.ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

        I like Marvel because of when I was younger, I remember being so obsessed with
        the Spider-Man movies.
        That led to dive deeper into the Marvel Universe.
        I absolutely adore Marvel and all it's works.
